### Project Objective And Implementation

During this time, I began to become interested in building web applications and web scrapers.

Project Challenges: Working with Google Graph API, building API's with Node.js, and Python web scraping.

I definitely had a hard time scraping [http://dongerlist.com/](http://dongerlist.com/) because
of the different sizes of the emoji characters.
