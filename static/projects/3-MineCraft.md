### Project Objective And Implementation

I wanted to explore game development with JAVA on my own and decided to attempt and
recreate Minecraft because the game is fun!

Project Challenges: Learning about lighting, frustrum, pitch, yee, yaw, simple noise, and textures.

I felt like this program was a good challenge; however, I am not sure if I would do this again haha ໒( • ͜ʖ • )७.
