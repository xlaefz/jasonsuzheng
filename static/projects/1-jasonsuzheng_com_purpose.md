# The Tipping Point
<!---
Why I rebuilt my website, again, and the reasoning behind my technology choices.

### Background

I had just finished an internship with a real estate investment firm and hated
it. I was going in to my senior year not knowing what to do and I really
couldn't find something that I was passionate about that kept me awake at
night wanting to learn more. At this point in time, school to me was nothing
more than a validator of my work ethic. As a Civil Engineering major, I would
force myself to learn Advance Theory of Structures, Structural Dynamics, and
etc. and do well; however, I felt like I wasn't true-ly learning.

<br>
I decided to start exploring other fields such as software engineering because
3/6 of my housemates were studying Computer Science or Computer Engineering/
Computer Science. I talked to them briefly about my career crisis and with
their support and mentorship I decided to enroll in my first computer science
course!

### Why

This really breaks down into a couple things, learning, and fun. After taking
the introductory course at USC I realized that I greatly enjoyed coding. The
coding assignments we did were not arduous tasks, but fun challenges. This
introductory course gave me the insight on what products can potentially be
made and the idea of start ups and making my own app excited me!

#### Learning

It has been about 1.5 years since the start of my journey (writing this 03/22/17)
and I believe that I have come a long way since the beginning. I would like to
say that I am proud of my accomplishments so far and am excited to be in this
fast pace field where learning never stops. I am currently interested in
mobile/backend development and will be honing my skills through making projects
with iOS, Node.js, and Flask.

#### Fun

Every project that I start on my own, I become very passionate about and would
work hours on end without getting tired. I enjoy the aspect of integrating design
with code and really appreciate aesthetics in application building.

### Purpose

I made this website to track my progress thus far and will make in the near future.
I would also like to thank my housemates again for giving me the courage to
step into a new field and providing me mentorship when I needed help.
