### Project Objective And Implementation

We built an Android applications which keeps track of what items are in a room.
It is useful because if we lose an item at home, we can determine what room we
lost it in.

This application was implemented through estimote bluetooth beacons/sensors, a pebble watch
for speech activation of the application, and an android phone for UI.

I helped work on the pebble watch hack, and this was pretty cool because we managed
to be able to use speech to ask the pebble watch which room a certain item was
using Pebble Speech Recognition API.

Project Challenges: Learning how to write clean and scalable code.
