### Project Objective And Implementation

I wanted to experiment more with user experience and make an application that can potentially make an impact on the USC community. This is an application to track users walking home and make sure they got home safely.

Project Challenges: Working with PXGoogleDirections API, Design Graphics, Firebase, and setting up PHP server to handle Twilio API text messaging.
